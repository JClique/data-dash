# data-dash

'data-dash' is a simple front-end application experimenting with data visualisation. It was written using Vue JS by developer J_Clique, who after spending years moving data around with Python decided to finally learn a real Front-End framework.

The inspiration for this project (and some of the first code!) was found in a video 'Data Visualisation with Vue JS' by Callum Macrae - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30v9xnB-GEo">here</a>
